# IPL Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of the **Indian Premier League (IPL) matches dataset**. The goal is to uncover key insights into team performance over the years, identify season winners, and analyze the impact of toss decisions and venue on match outcomes. The project leverages **data visualization** and **statistical techniques** to discover meaningful patterns in the dataset.

## 🔍 Key Insights
- **Team Performance Trends**: Analysis of team performances across different IPL seasons.
- **Season Winners**: Identifying the winners of each season based on match data.
- **Toss Impact**: Evaluating how winning the toss influences match results.
- **Venue Analysis**: Understanding how different stadiums impact team performance.
- **Visualizations**: Graphical representations of trends and patterns in IPL matches.
